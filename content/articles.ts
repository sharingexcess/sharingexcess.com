    body: 'Sharing Excess came to be when a Drexel student gave away 50 meals left in his dining account to people in need. He inspired others to join his efforts, which grew to include excess “food rescue” from a network of grocers, restaurants, farmers, and wholesalers. Today the nonprofit delivers an average of 100,000 pounds of food each week. The ultimate vision of Sharing Excess is to use every available resource that is wasted or underutilized to cover basic needs for all.',

Sharing Excess, the fledgling food rescue nonprofit founded by Ehlers and staffed by college students, sprung into action. In 48 hours, Ehlers and his team rescued more than 10,000 pounds of food — enough to feed roughly 90 families of four for a week — from 24 different restaurants, including Saxby’s cafes and Stephen Starr locations.

In communities everywhere, food is going to waste while people suffer from food insecurity. This is a disconnect created by the logistical barriers between excess and scarcity. If solved, this connection could ensure food security for all people living on our planet. But as vast a problem as food waste is, the solution often boils down to simple last mile logistics and delivery. Sharing Excess is meeting this challenge with the power of people, technology, and compassion.',
